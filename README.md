# DotFed

This is primarily a experiment in C#, Go and Zig. 


This is all going to be hosted via k3.

# Tech stack


Backend: I am using C# Razor files with a Minimal API because of the speed and less design patterns that I find unnatural.


Frontend: HTMX + TypeScript + UnoCSS for general use and then Zig WebAssembly for a client side worker.


Worker: Currently it is being written in Go as it has good support with RabbitMQ, JSON and Postgres while being fast but I plan on switching to Zig by making my own implementations in all of these pain points.


Mobile: Expo + Zig WASM


API: A C# Minimal API because of the speed and ease of use.


Devops: Github Actions + ghcr.io + Kubernetes.
